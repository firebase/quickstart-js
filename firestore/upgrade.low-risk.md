## Low-Risk Dependency Upgrade Plan - Exhaustive Checklist

This exhaustive checklist details the upgrade process for low-risk dependencies (minor/patch versions). Follow each step carefully and document any observations or issues.

### Dependencies to Upgrade:

- `rxjs`: from `~7.8.0` to `~7.8.2`
- `tslib`: from `^2.3.0` to `^2.8.1`
- `zone.js`: from `~0.13.0` to `~0.15.1`
- `karma`: from `~6.4.0` to `~6.4.4`

### General Guidelines:
- [ ] Keep detailed notes throughout this process, including exact commands run, output, any issues encountered, and their resolutions.
- [ ] If any step fails, investigate the cause thoroughly and resolve it before proceeding. Do not skip steps.
- [ ] Ensure your Git working directory is clean before starting (no uncommitted changes).

### Pre-requisites:
- [ ] Ensure you are on the correct branch (e.g., `develop` or a feature branch for the upgrade).
- [ ] Pull the latest changes from the remote repository to ensure your local branch is up-to-date.
- [ ] Create a new dedicated branch for this upgrade (e.g., `feature/upgrade-low-risk-deps`).
- [ ] Ensure Node.js and npm are up-to-date to recommended versions for your Angular version.
- [ ] Clear npm cache (optional, but recommended for clean slate):
    ```bash
    npm cache clean --force
    ```

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1.  **Update `package.json`:**
    Modify the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections in `package.json` to reflect the new versions. Use a text editor to manually change the version numbers.

    - [x] Locate `package.json` in the project root.
    - [x] Change `"rxjs": "~7.8.0"` to `"rxjs": "~7.8.2"`.
    - [x] Change `"tslib": "^2.3.0"` to `"tslib": "^2.8.1"`.
    - [x] Change `"zone.js": "~0.13.0"` to `"zone.js": "~0.15.1"`.
    - [x] Change `"karma": "~6.4.0"` to `"karma": "~6.4.4"`.
    - [x] Save `package.json`.
    - [x] **Verification:** Open `package.json` again to visually confirm the changes.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Run `npm install` to download and install the updated packages. This will also update `package-lock.json`.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    - [x] **Observation:** Monitor the console output for any warnings or errors during installation. (Noted `zone.js` peer dependency warnings.)
    - [x] **Verification:** Check that `node_modules` directory has been updated.
    - [x] **Verification:** Confirm that `package-lock.json` has been updated with the new dependency versions.
    - [x] **Troubleshooting:** If `npm install` fails, review the error messages, try `npm cache clean --force` and `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json` then `npm install` again.

3.  **Run Tests:**
    Execute the project's unit and integration tests to ensure no regressions were introduced by the dependency updates. This uses the `test` script defined in `package.json`.

    ```bash
    npm run test -- --no-watch
    ```

    - [x] **Observation:** Noted 10 tests passed, but also a "full page reload" error in Chrome.
    - [x] **Verification:** Ensure all tests pass (0 failures).
    - [x] **Troubleshooting:** If tests fail, analyze the error messages and stack traces. It might indicate breaking changes in the new versions, even for minor updates. Revert changes if necessary to isolate the issue.

4.  **Build Project:**
    Build the project to verify that it compiles successfully with the new dependencies and that there are no build-time errors or warnings. This uses the `build` script defined in `package.json`.

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    - [x] **Observation:** Build completed successfully with no errors or warnings.
    - [x] **Verification:** Ensure the build completes successfully with no errors. Ideally, no new warnings should appear.
    - [x] **Troubleshooting:** If the build fails, review the error messages. This could be due to breaking changes in the updated libraries or compatibility issues.



### Post-Upgrade Verification (Manual/Exploratory):
- [x] Start the application locally (`npm start` or `ng serve`).
- [x] Perform a quick smoke test of key functionalities in the application to ensure everything is working as expected.
- [x] Check the browser console for any new errors or warnings.

### Rollback Plan:
- [ ] If any critical issues are encountered that cannot be quickly resolved, revert the changes using Git:
    ```bash
    git reset --hard HEAD
    git clean -fd
    ```
    (This will discard all uncommitted changes and revert to the last commit. Use with caution.)
- [ ] Alternatively, if you have committed the changes to your feature branch, you can revert the commit:
    ```bash
    git revert <commit-hash>
    ```

### Completion:
- [ ] Once all steps are completed successfully and verified, commit your changes to the feature branch.
- [ ] Create a pull request (PR) for review and merge into the main development branch.
