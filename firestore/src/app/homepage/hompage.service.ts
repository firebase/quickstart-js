/**
 * The `HomepageFirestore` service class provides functionality that allows
 * the Homepage component to recieve data from the Firestore database.
 * The class is marked with the @Injectable decorator, which allows it to be
 * injected into the Homepage component via the `inject()` function. The
 * benefit of injecting this service class, as opposed to calling the Firestore
 * methods from directly within the Homepage component, is that injection 
 * allows for the component's UI logic to be decoupled from its datafetching
 * logic. This decoupling enables the HomepageComponent to be unit tested with
 * a mock implementation of this datafetching class that simply returns 
 * predefined data without needing to establish a connection to a running 
 * instance of Firestore (as showcased by the MockHomepageFirestore implemented 
 * in `homepage.component.spec.ts`). Such decoupling, and the ability to be 
 * unit tested, would not be possible if the HomepageComponent's Firestore 
 * methods had been written directly into the`homepage.component.ts` file.
 * 
 * For more information about dependency injection and unit testing in Angular
 * visit the Angular docs: https://angular.dev/
