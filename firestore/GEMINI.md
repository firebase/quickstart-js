A Firestore quickstart application for the web

- This folder contains the frontend logic
- `functions/` contains the backend logic
- `scripts/` has helper code for the firebase emulator

## Architecture
- Use `npm` for dependencies. Always ask before adding a new dependency.
- Use typescript for coding
- This is a simple Angular web application
- Source code is in `src/`

## Essential commands
- Build with `npm build`
- Run tests with `npm test`
- Format code with `npm fmt`

## Workflow
- Use a separate git branch for each major task
- Make small commits frequently
- Use conventional commits messages
- Format code files before making commits
- Ensure tests pass before making commits
- Changes to the frontend and backend should happen in separate commits
